    "Lasso Regression, short for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator Regression, is a linear regression technique used in machine learning and statistics. It is a variant of linear regression that introduces a regularization term into the regression objective function to address issues like multicollinearity and perform automatic feature selection. Lasso Regression is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets where there may be many predictors (independent variables) and a need to select the most relevant ones.\n",
