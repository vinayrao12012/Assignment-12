    "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which an algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions or decisions. In supervised learning, the algorithm is provided with input-output pairs (features and corresponding target labels) during training. It learns to map the input data to the correct output by identifying patterns and relationships in the labeled examples. The goal is for the algorithm to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.\n",

    "    2. Importance: Without a separate validation set, it's challenging to optimize a model's hyperparameters effectively. The validation set acts as a proxy for unseen data and helps prevent overfitting (a situation where the model performs well on training data but poorly on new data).\n",

It measures how well the model can make predictions on real-world data that it hasn't encountered before. The test set results are a critical indicator of the model's ability to perform in a production or real-world setting."
