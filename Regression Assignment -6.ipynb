    "- Traditional Web Hosting: In traditional hosting, you typically rent or lease a specific physical server or a portion of a server from a hosting provider. The hosting provider owns, maintains, and manages the hardware and network infrastructure. You have limited control over the underlying hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cloud Hosting: Cloud hosting, on the other hand, relies on a distributed network of virtual servers and resources provided by cloud service providers like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. You don't own or manage the physical hardware; instead, you use virtualized resources on a pay-as-you-go basis. Cloud providers handle infrastructure maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditional Web Hosting: Scaling in traditional hosting can be challenging. You often need to predict your resource requirements in advance and may face limitations in terms of hardware capacity. Scaling typically involves upgrading your hosting plan or migrating to a more powerful server.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cloud Hosting: Cloud hosting offers elastic scalability. You can easily scale your resources up or down based on demand. Cloud providers allow you to add or remove virtual servers, storage, and other resources in real-time, ensuring that your application can handle varying workloads efficiently."
