    "Linear regression and logistic regression are both types of supervised machine learning models used for different types of tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Type of Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear Regression: Linear regression is used for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict a continuous numeric value. It models the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable as a straight line.\n",
    "- Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is used for classification tasks, where the goal is to predict a categorical outcome, typically binary (yes/no, 0/1, true/false). It models the probability of the outcome belonging to a particular class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear Regression: It is suitable for tasks like predicting house prices, estimating sales based on advertising spend, or any other regression problem where the target variable is continuous.\n",
    "- Logistic Regression: It is appropriate for binary classification tasks such as spam email detection (classifying emails as spam or not), medical diagnosis (disease or no disease), and sentiment analysis (positive or negative sentiment).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Scenario for Logistic Regression:\n",
    "Let's consider the scenario of a medical researcher trying to predict whether a patient has a particular disease based on various medical test results. The outcome in this case is binary: either the patient has the disease (1) or does not have the disease (0). Logistic regression is more appropriate for this task because it can model the probability of a patient having the disease based on the test results, and the researcher can set a threshold probability (e.g., 0.5) to classify patients into the two categories. Linear regression, on the other hand, would not be suitable as it predicts continuous values and cannot directly handle binary classification tasks."

    "In logistic regression, the cost function used is the logistic loss function, also known as the cross-entropy loss function or the log loss. The purpose of the cost function is to measure the error between the predicted probabilities and the actual binary labels in a classification problem. The logistic loss function is defined as follows for a binary classification problem with two classes (0 and 1)\n",

The goal is to find the model parameters that result in the lowest logistic loss, making the model's predictions as close as possible to the actual labels.\n",

    "Regularization is a technique used in logistic regression (and other machine learning models) to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model learns to fit the training data too closely, capturing noise and making it less effective at making accurate predictions on new, unseen data. Overfitting can lead to poor generalization and reduced model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Regularization Helps Prevent Overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Regularization helps prevent overfitting by adding a cost associated with the magnitude of the model's weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. This encourages the model to have smaller weights, which makes it less sensitive to small variations in the training data and less prone to fitting noise.\n",
    "3. By penalizing large weights, regularization discourages the model from assigning too much importance to any one feature. This helps prevent the model from becoming too complex and overfitting the training data."
