    "Ordinal encoding and label encoding are both techniques used to convert categorical data into numerical format. However, they differ in how they handle the categorical values and the types of categorical variables they are best suited for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Nature: Ordinal encoding is used when the categorical variable has ordered categories or a natural ranking among its values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Encoding Process: In ordinal encoding, each unique category is assigned a numeric value based on its order or rank. The assigned numeric values typically follow the order of the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Example: Consider a variable \"Education Level\" with categories \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's,\" \"Master's,\" and \"Ph.D.\" Here, there is a clear order or hierarchy, and ordinal encoding can be used to assign values like 1, 2, 3, and 4 based on the level of education.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Nature: Label encoding is used when the categorical variable represents distinct categories with no inherent order or ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Encoding Process: In label encoding, each unique category is assigned a numeric label, typically starting from 0 or 1 and increasing sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Example: Consider a variable \"Gender\" with categories \"Male\" and \"Female.\" There is no inherent order between these categories, so label encoding can be used to assign labels like 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Use:\n",
    "1. Choose ordinal encoding when the categorical variable has meaningful ordinal relationships among its categories. For example, variables like \"Education Level,\" \"Income Bracket,\" or \"Severity Level\" often have a natural order.\n",
    "2. Choose label encoding when the categorical variable represents distinct categories with no inherent order, such as \"Gender,\" \"Color,\" or \"Country.\""

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables when there is a clear ordinal relationship between the categories, and the encoding is guided by the target variable (the variable you are trying to predict).\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "1. Calculate Statistics: For each unique category in the categorical variable, calculate a relevant statistic based on the target variable. Common statistics used are the mean, median, or any other summary statistic that reflects the relationship between the category and the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Order Categories: Order the categories based on the calculated statistics in ascending or descending order. The order represents the ordinal relationship between the categories with respect to their impact on the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Assign Numeric Labels: Assign numeric labels (ordinal values) to the categories according to their order. You can choose to start from 1, 0, or any other value depending on your preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Replace Categorical Values: Replace the original categorical values in the dataset with the assigned numeric labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario: You are working on a project to predict customer churn in a telecom company. You have a dataset with a categorical variable \"Customer Feedback\" that contains feedback categories: \"Highly Satisfied,\" \"Satisfied,\" \"Neutral,\" \"Unsatisfied,\" and \"Highly Unsatisfied.\" You believe there is an ordinal relationship between these feedback categories, with \"Highly Unsatisfied\" being the most critical and \"Highly Satisfied\" being the most positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate Statistics:\n",
    "    1. Calculate the mean of the target variable (e.g., churn rate) for each feedback category.\n",
    "    2. Order the feedback categories based on the mean in descending order, reflecting their impact on churn rate.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Order Categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. After calculating the means, you might find that the order is as follows:\n",
    "        1. \"Highly Unsatisfied\"\n",

    "        3. \"Neutral\"\n",
    "        4. \"Satisfied\"\n",
    "        5. \"Highly Satisfied\"  \n",
    "        \n",
    "3. Assign Numeric Labels:\n",
    "    1. Assign numeric labels to the categories based on their order:\n",
    "        1. \"Highly Unsatisfied\" → 1\n",
    "        2. \"Unsatisfied\" → 2\n",
