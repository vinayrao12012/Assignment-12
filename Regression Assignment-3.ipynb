    "Ridge Regression introduces a regularization term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression objective function to address multicollinearity and reduce the risk of overfitting. The main idea behind Ridge Regression is to add a penalty term based on the sum of the squared coefficients to the OLS cost function.\n",

    "Differences from Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Multicollinearity Handling: One of the primary motivations for Ridge Regression is its ability to handle multicollinearity, which occurs when predictors in the regression model are highly correlated. OLS regression is sensitive to multicollinearity and can lead to unstable coefficient estimates. Ridge Regression, by adding the penalty term, shrinks the coefficients and reduces their variance, making the model more robust to multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Regularization Parameter (λ): Ridge Regression introduces the regularization parameter (λ), which controls the trade-off between fitting the data and shrinking the coefficients. A higher λ value leads to stronger regularization and more substantial coefficient shrinkage. In OLS regression, there is no regularization parameter, and the model is fit solely based on minimizing the sum of squared differences between predicted and actual values."

    "Ridge Regression shares many of the same assumptions with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression since it is an extension of OLS. These assumptions are crucial for the validity of the model's results. The key assumptions of Ridge Regression are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linearity: Ridge Regression assumes that the relationship between the independent variables (predictors) and the dependent variable is linear. This means that changes in the predictors have a constant and additive effect on the dependent variable.\n",
    "2. Independence of Errors: It is assumed that the errors (residuals), which are the differences between the observed values and the predicted values, are independent of each other. There should be no systematic patterns or correlations in the residuals.\n",
    "3. No Perfect Multicollinearity: While Ridge Regression can handle some degree of multicollinearity (high correlation among predictors), it assumes that there is no perfect multicollinearity, where one predictor can be perfectly predicted by a linear combination of other predictors."
