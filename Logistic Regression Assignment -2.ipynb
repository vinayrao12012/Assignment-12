    "Grid Search with Cross-Validation (Grid Search CV) is a technique used in machine learning to find the optimal hyperparameters for a model. Its purpose is to systematically search through a predefined set of hyperparameter combinations, evaluating the model's performance using cross-validation. The primary goals of Grid Search CV are to automate the hyperparameter tuning process and select the combination that results in the best model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define Hyperparameter Grid:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, you specify a grid of hyperparameters that you want to tune. This grid includes the hyperparameters of the model and the range of values or options for each hyperparameter.\n",

    "2. Define a Scoring Metric:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You also select a performance metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, ROC AUC) that you want to optimize. Grid Search CV will use this metric to evaluate the model's performance for each hyperparameter combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Grid Search CV uses k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance. It divides the training data into k subsets (folds) and iteratively trains and validates the model k times. In each iteration, one fold is used as the validation set, and the remaining k-1 folds are used for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Select the Best Combination:\n",
    "\n",
    "- After evaluating all combinations, Grid Search CV identifies the hyperparameter combination that results in the highest average performance score (based on the chosen scoring metric). This combination is considered the best set of hyperparameters for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Train the Model with Best Hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
